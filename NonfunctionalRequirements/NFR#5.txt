Type: 12 Performance
Rationale: To provide benefit the system must responds quickly to a request, the system will hinder therapists if they must wait to retrieve the required information.
Fit Criterion: The system should never take more than 10 seconds to produce a report, with 90% of reports taking under 5 seconds to produce.

[JD] There is quite a large variance between the maximum time of 10 seconds and the average for 90% of cases of 2 seconds. Looking at an example from MRP (page 288), 
the Fit Criterion specifies that schedules should be available in 15 seconds but never more than 20 seconds. Perhaps saying the minimum time in 90% of report requests
is 5 seconds is more achiivable? This allows also for larger files being output as patients build up a history with the clinic and more data needs to be downloaded.
[TB] Depends on what the report is and what the report contains. If this is simply access to patient records this may be appropriate. How would this feature with the network and latency?
